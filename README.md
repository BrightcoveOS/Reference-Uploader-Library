====================

> Frontend module for direct multipart upload to s3 with secret sauce for Brightcove ingest

## What Is This?

Evaporate Brightcove is an npm module providing JavaScript for use in the browser to upload videos to your [Brightcove Video Cloud](https://www.brightcove.com/en/online-video-platform). In order to use this module, you'll also need to setup a server to which can secure manage your Brightcove and AWS credentials -- we've included a working reference implementation for Node.js to help you get started.

 * Highly configurable:

    * capture error reports
    * measure transfer speed
    * custom validation prior to upload
