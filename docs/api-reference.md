API Reference
=============

Everything that follows is an object on the constructor.

### Required Parameters

#### `root` (string)

> CSS ID of the root element to display the uploader

Example:

```html
<div id="video-uploader"></div>
<script>
BCUploader({
  root: 'video-uploader',
  // ...
});
</script>
```

---

#### `createVideoEndpoint` (string)

> URL for creating new Brightcove video and returning multi-part upload data

 * See the [example server](./examples/nodes/src/controllers/upload.js) to get a good idea of what happens at this endpoint
 * Make sure this server is on the same domain name, otherwise you'll have to handle CORS

Example:

```html
<script>
BCUploader({
  createVideoEndpoint: '/upload',
  // ...
});
</script>
```

```js
// On server
router.get('/upload', function(req, res) {
  // Create Brightcove video and return AWS upload parameters
});
```

---

#### `signUploadEndpoint` (string)

> URL on server which signs S3 uploads using AWS secret key (without transmitting the secret key)

 * The actual path the server will receive requests on will have the videoId appended (ex: /sign/1234)
 * Make sure this server is on the same domain name, otherwise you'll have to handle CORS

Example:

```html
<script>
BCUploader({
  signUploadEndpoint: '/sign',
  // ...
});
</script>
```

```js
// On server
router.get('/sign/:videoId', function(req, res) {
  // Do AWS request signing here
});
```

---

#### `ingestUploadEndpoint` (string)

> URL to request once S3 upload is complete; starts Dynamic Ingest on object in S3


 * The actual path the server will receive requests on will have the videoId appended (ex: /ingest/1234)
 * Make sure this server is on the same domain name, otherwise you'll have to handle CORS

Example:

```html
<script>
BCUploader({
  ingestUploadEndpoint: '/ingest',
  // ...
});
</script>
```

```js
// On server
router.get('/ingest/:videoId', function(req, res) {
  // Call Brightcove Dynamic Ingest here
});
```

### Optional Parameters

#### previewText (string)

> Text to display in preview link, after transcoding is done

 * Default: "Preview"

---

#### onPreview (function)

> Callback which is invoked when Preview link is clicked

If a `playerId` is provided to BCUploader, the default implementation will
creating a player over the Drag n' Drop landing area and try to playback the video.

NOTE: At this time, there is no way for BCUploader to know if a transcode is actually
complete, so it's entirely possible this will be a suboptimal experience for the user.

Use `transcodeDelayMS` to tune the default wait time before showing the preview link.

 * See the default implementation at [src/components/default-preview.js](../src/components/default-preview.js)
 * See the lower level updatePreview() implementation at [src/components/preview.js](../src/components/preview.js)
 * Callback is called with "context" object having these properties:
   * `defaultPreviewAction` (function) - see link above. Useful for using the default but adding tracking code or firing other events on the rest of the page.
   * `updatePreview` (function) - allows you use the builtin preview function but provide different videoId, accountId, or playerId
   * `rootElement` (DOM node) - useful for direct manipulation of DOM if you want to forego the builtin preview functionality
   * `videoId` (number) - Brightcove Video ID. Useful for constructing a player, among other things
   * `accountId` (number) - Brightcove account ID. Useful for constructing a player, among other things
   * `playerId` (string) - the `playerId` possibly provided to BCUploader constructor
   * `fileName` (string) - file name from the original file upload
   * `fileSize` (number) - the number of bytes for the upload

Example:

```js
<script>
BCUploader({
  playerId: 1234567890,
  onPreview: function(context) {
    console.log(context.playerId);         // Hy9fawLj43
    console.log(context.videoId);          // 2345678001
    console.log(context.accountId);        // 3456789100112
    console.log(context.fileName);         // "cats.mp4"
    console.log(context.fileSize);         // 90654201
    console.log(context.rootElement);      // <DOM node for the root of the BCUploader instance>
    context.updatePreview({videoId:23456, playerId: 'default', accountId: '12345'}); // Renders default preview in default preview DOM element
    context.defaultPreviewAction(context); // Performs the default preview
  },
  // ...
});
</script>
```

---

#### playerId (number)

> Brightcove player ID for use in previewing a video after transcode

This player ID will be passed to the onPreview callback as part of the context. If not provided,
the default player for the account is used.

 * Default: 'default'

---

#### landingText (string)

> Text shown in the Drag n Drop area

 * Default: "Drag Files here to Upload"

---

#### transcodingDelayMS (number)

> Milliseconds to wait for transcoding to finish

For simplicity, we don't actually check to see if the transcoding is complete; instead we just update
the UI optimistically after a certain amount of time.

 * Default: 5000

---

#### transcodingText (string)

> Status text shown next to video after Dynamic Ingest begins

 * Default: "Transcoding"

---

#### onProgress (function)

> Regularly fired callback which provides progress information

 * Default: `function(){}`
 * Callback is called with these arguments:
   1. `percent` (number) - between 0 and 1
   2. `statistics` (object)
     * speed (float) - average speed, bytes/second
     * readableSpeed (string) - human readable speed
     * loaded (int) - bytes loaded since last progress event

Example:

```js
<script>
BCUploader({
  onProgress: function(percent, stats) {
    console.log(percent);             // 0.239
    console.log(stats.speed);         // 70343222.003493043
    console.log(stats.readableSpeed); // "703 Kb",
    console.log(stats.loaded);        // 7034333
  },
  // ...
});
</script>
```

---

#### onStarted (function)

> Callback fired when the file upload is started in the browser

NOTE: The S3 upload has not necessarily started at this point.

 * Default: `function(){}`
 * Callback receives the name of the file as a string

---

#### onComplete (function)

> Callback fired when a file is finished uploading to S3

---

#### onUploadInitiated (function)

> Callback fired when S3 assigns an upload ID

---

#### onFileSelected (function)

> Callback when the user selects a file

This call MUST return a promise. If the promise rejects, the upload is aborted. You can use this asynchronously validate a file prior to upload.

Example:

```js
<script>
BCUploader({
  onFileSelected: function(file) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      if (!file.name.endsWith("mp4")) {
        reject("Only mp4s can be uploaded");
      } else {
        resolve(file);
      }
    });
  },
  // ...
});
</script>
```

---

#### onError (function)

> Callback fires any time an error occurs during upload to S3

---

#### logging (bool)

> Enable Evaporate's debug logging to the console if true

This option turns on very verbose logging to console. It includes information about each part that is being uploaded, what information is being signed and what signatures were calculated on the server, and more.

 * Defaut: false

Example:

```js
<script>
BCUploader({
  logging: true
  // ...
});
</script>
```

#### evaporate (object)

> Config passed directly to evaporate, bypassing Evaporate Brightcove

See the full list of options on [the npm module page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/evaporate).

Example:

```js
<script>
BCUploader({
  evaporate: {
    logging: false
  },
  // ...
});
</script>
```
